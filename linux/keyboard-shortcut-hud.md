# Ubuntu Desktop keyboard shortcuts HUD

When you log in for the first time to an Ubuntu Desktop account you'll see a "head's up display" (HUD) window listing a number of useful keyboard shortcuts. But the next time you log in that window isn't displayed; and if you didn't read it then you might not have any idea how to make it appear again.

You get that keyboard shortcut HUD again by pressing and holding the Super key. The Super key is usually the Windows Flag key on most keyboards, or the Command key on an Apple keyboard.

I found this helpful info from this Stack Exchange "Ask Ubuntu" question: [http://askubuntu.com/questions/534250/re-enable-keyboard-shortcuts-first-login-cheat-sheet](http://askubuntu.com/questions/534250/re-enable-keyboard-shortcuts-first-login-cheat-sheet)
