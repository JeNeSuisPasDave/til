# Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning is sometimes mentioned in language specifications and convention guides. This multi-lingual site helpfully explains the convention: [http://semver.org/](http://semver.org/)

Essentially, a semantic version string consists of three parts. The major number, the minor number, and the patch number.

No discussion of extra fields, like: ".pre", "p481", "-p481", ".a", ".b1".

Microsoft .NET and perhaps Ruby call the 3rd number the "build" number. Microsoft adds a 4th number they call the patch number. Ruby seems to indicate patch numbers by the "p123" or "-p123" convention.
