# Compare working file with another branch

To compare a working file with that from another branch, use the following syntax:

```bash
git diff other-branch:src-dir/src-file.c src-dir/src-file.c
```

I discovered that method here: [http://stackoverflow.com/a/9113407/1392864](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9113407/1392864).
